		<h1>Lab 3 File Structure</h1>
		<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my coputer and add index.html files.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>It was easy creating the file structure once I got the hang of it, but I had some difficulty creating index.html files and making them work right</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Well you are looking at the index file I created. Here is the file structure that I made:</p>
		<img src="images/file-structure.png" width=650>
		<p>This is my .html file that I had created:</p>
		<img src="images/html.png" width=650"
		<p>This is what it looks in a Chrome browser:</p>
