		<h1>Subject of This Lab</h1>
		<p>For this lab I will be creating an HTML file and will be sharing it in my local file and then uploading them into a server.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>One of the challenges that had occured was publishing the right file. I didn't properly label the cst251 folder, accidentally renaming it to "cst25." Also, I majorly messed up and accidentally commited all of the files before screenshotting. I think this is where having a partner would actually work better, so they can stop me before I fuck up. ;-;</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>This is the Atom screenshot.</p>
