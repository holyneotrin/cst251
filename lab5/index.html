		<h1>Subject of This Lab</h1>
			<p>Today I will be linking a few images in this index and then also adding a few links.</p>
		<h1>Difficulties Encountered</h1>
			<p>I had a hard time linking the images, only because I didn't start the code with "img/" I just straight for the file name. I quickly fixed it after referencing my lab 4 file.</p>
		<h1>Results of Work</h1>
		<p>Here are two images from my computer. The first image is a digital drawing that I drew of Hypnos from the game, Hades. The second picture is a meme about having your work being on the wrong layer, a painful moment for all artists and designers.</p><br>
		<img src="img/hypnos-doodle.png" width="500"><br>
		<img src="img/layer-funny.jpg" width="500"> <br>
		<p>In this section I will link my instagram account. I haven't posted in a couple years, so the pictures are quite old.</p><br>
