		<h2>Subject of This Lab</h2>
			<p>We'll be using CSS more and customizing even more!! And look at the cool drawing that I never finished! He's a pretty neat bird hehehe.</p>
		<h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
			<p>I could not figure out how to work the hover image function in CSS. For some reason, the notations wouldn't go through and then realign the image into a different areas of the webpage. Another difficulty was just designing the page. I couldn't figure out how I wanted to design the page specifically.</p>
		<h2>Results of Work</h2>
		<p>Hello, welcome to the result!</p><br>
